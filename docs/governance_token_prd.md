### UIR3: Progress Reporting
Long-running operations must provide clear progress indicators showing current status, estimated completion time, and any errors or warnings encountered during processing.

### UIR4: Output Customization
Users must be able to specify output formats, detail levels, and specific metrics to include in reports. The system should support both summary reports for quick insights and comprehensive reports for detailed analysis.

## Performance Requirements

### PR1: Response Time Targets

## Lessons Learned

- **API Key Management:** Not all API endpoints are available for free; some (e.g., Etherscan token holder list) require a paid tier. The system must be able to detect missing or invalid API keys and handle them gracefully.
- **Fallback Logic is Essential:** Robust fallback logic is required to ensure the tool remains functional even when some data providers are unavailable or rate-limited.
- **Data Validation:** Always validate the structure and quality of data returned from APIs before analysis. This prevents silent failures and ensures meaningful results.
- **Error and Warning Logging:** Comprehensive logging of errors and warnings is critical for debugging and for users to understand the system's state.
- **Executable Scripts:** All scripts and modules must be executable and discoverable via the correct Python path for smooth operation and testing.

## Next Steps
