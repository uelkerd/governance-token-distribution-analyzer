# File Size Limit Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to refactor the Governance Token Distribution Analyzer codebase to enforce a 500-line limit per file. This initiative aims to improve code maintainability, testability, and overall quality by breaking down large, complex files into smaller, more focused components.

## Goals

1. Improve code maintainability by reducing file size and complexity
2. Enhance testability by creating more focused components
3. Increase test coverage through better separation of concerns
4. Establish a sustainable architecture for future development
5. Reduce cognitive load for developers working on the codebase

## Identified Large Files (Priority Order)

Based on initial analysis, the following files exceed the 500-line limit and are candidates for refactoring:

1. src/governance_token_analyzer/visualization/report_generator.py (1939 lines) - COMPLETED
2. src/governance_token_analyzer/core/api_client.py (~1000+ lines)
3. src/governance_token_analyzer/core/data_processor.py (~800+ lines)
4. src/governance_token_analyzer/core/data_simulator.py (~700+ lines)
5. src/governance_token_analyzer/core/analyzer.py (~600+ lines)
6. tests/integration/test_visualization_integration.py (~600+ lines)
7. tests/integration/test_cli_integration.py (~550+ lines)

## Refactoring Strategy

### General Approach

1. Create feature-specific packages for large modules
2. Extract cohesive functionality into separate files
3. Apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing API
5. Improve test coverage during refactoring

### File-Specific Strategies

#### 1. report_generator.py (COMPLETED)

The report generator has been successfully refactored into a package with the following components:

- report_generator_base.py: Core ReportGenerator class
- html_report_generator.py: HTML report generation functions
- historical_report_generator.py: Historical analysis report functions
- comprehensive_report.py: Comprehensive report generation
- __init__.py: Exports the main classes and functions

This approach preserved the original API while breaking down the complex functionality into more manageable components.

#### 2. api_client.py

Proposed structure:
- api_client/: Package directory
  - __init__.py: Exports the main APIClient class
  - base_client.py: Base client with common functionality
  - ethereum_client.py: Ethereum-specific client implementation
  - protocol_client.py: Protocol-specific client implementation
  - data_fetcher.py: Data fetching utilities
  - response_parser.py: Response parsing utilities

#### 3. data_processor.py

Proposed structure:
- data_processor/: Package directory
  - __init__.py: Exports the main DataProcessor class
  - base_processor.py: Base processor with common functionality
  - token_processor.py: Token data processing
  - governance_processor.py: Governance data processing
  - metrics_calculator.py: Metrics calculation utilities
  - data_transformer.py: Data transformation utilities

#### 4. data_simulator.py

Proposed structure:
- data_simulator/: Package directory
  - __init__.py: Exports the main DataSimulator class
  - base_simulator.py: Base simulator with common functionality
  - token_simulator.py: Token data simulation
  - governance_simulator.py: Governance data simulation
  - distribution_models.py: Distribution model implementations
  - random_generators.py: Random data generation utilities

#### 5. analyzer.py

Proposed structure:
- analyzer/: Package directory
  - __init__.py: Exports the main Analyzer class
  - base_analyzer.py: Base analyzer with common functionality
  - token_analyzer.py: Token distribution analysis
  - governance_analyzer.py: Governance analysis
  - metrics_analyzer.py: Metrics analysis
  - historical_analyzer.py: Historical data analysis

#### 6. Test Files

For test files, we'll refactor them by test category:
- Split integration tests by feature area
- Create separate test files for different components
- Maintain a consistent naming convention

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (COMPLETED)

- [x] Create refactoring branch (refactor/file-size-limit)
- [x] Identify files exceeding the 500-line limit
- [x] Document refactoring plan
- [x] Refactor report_generator.py as a proof of concept

### Phase 2: Core Components Refactoring

- [ ] Refactor api_client.py
- [ ] Refactor data_processor.py
- [ ] Update imports in dependent files
- [ ] Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved
- [ ] Update documentation

### Phase 3: Additional Components Refactoring

- [ ] Refactor data_simulator.py
- [ ] Refactor analyzer.py
- [ ] Update imports in dependent files
- [ ] Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved
- [ ] Update documentation

### Phase 4: Test Files Refactoring

- [ ] Refactor test_visualization_integration.py
- [ ] Refactor test_cli_integration.py
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Update documentation

### Phase 5: Final Steps

- [ ] Run linting and formatting checks
- [ ] Update project documentation
- [ ] Create pull request
- [ ] Address review feedback
- [ ] Merge to main branch

## Testing Strategy

1. Maintain existing tests during refactoring
2. Add unit tests for newly extracted components
3. Run integration tests to ensure system functionality is preserved
4. Add test coverage for previously untested code paths
5. Use CI/CD pipeline to validate changes

## Coding Standards

1. Maximum file size: 500 lines
2. Clear and consistent naming conventions
3. Comprehensive docstrings for all public APIs
4. Type hints for all function signatures
5. Single responsibility principle for all modules

## Success Criteria

1. All files are under the 500-line limit
2. No regression in functionality
3. Test coverage maintained or improved
4. CI/CD pipeline passes
5. Code review approval

## Conclusion

This refactoring effort will significantly improve the maintainability and testability of the Governance Token Distribution Analyzer codebase. By breaking down large, complex files into smaller, more focused components, we'll reduce cognitive load, improve separation of concerns, and make the codebase more approachable for new developers.
