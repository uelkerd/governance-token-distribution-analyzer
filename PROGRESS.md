## Development Notes

### Project Structure
- The project follows a modern Python package structure with code in the `src/` directory
- The main package is located at `src/governance_token_analyzer/`

### Running Tests
- Set your PYTHONPATH to include the src directory:
  ```
  export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src
  ```
- Run pytest from the project root:
  ```
  pytest src/tests
  ```
- Or with more verbose output:
  ```
  pytest -v src/tests
  ```

### Import Strategy
- All imports in the project should reference the package from the src directory
- Example: `from governance_token_analyzer.core import metrics` 

### Code Quality Lessons Learned
- Complex functions with nested conditionals should be refactored into smaller, focused helper methods
- Date parsing and snapshot searching are better handled as separate concerns
- File I/O operations should be isolated from data processing logic
- Error handling should be comprehensive with proper logging
- Functions should follow single responsibility principle
