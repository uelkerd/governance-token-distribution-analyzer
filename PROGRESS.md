## Recent Achievements Highlight

### Project Health Recovery (Major Milestone)
Successfully recovered from a broken codebase state to a fully functional system through systematic debugging:

1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified missing `logging_config.py` as the source of cascading import failures
2. **Systematic Remediation**: Used `rsync` to consolidate directories, `ruff` for code quality, targeted fixes for data mismatches
3. **Mathematical Debugging**: Solved complex Jaccard similarity calculation discrepancy through algorithm analysis and test data correction
4. **Quality Assurance**: Achieved 100% test success rate through comprehensive testing and validation

This demonstrates strong debugging skills, systematic problem-solving approach, and attention to both technical and mathematical accuracy.
